# ballista-theme

Here's another theme that is pretty much ready for release but we never got around to it.  
Again, I worked on this one with the very talented Michael Wong (@mizko) as a follow-up to Broadsword, with the intent to release it on ThemeForest.  This theme got as far as running the theme check plugin against the code and making the necessary changes, but we never did submit it.

It's a straight up blog theme with some nice layout options, so grab a copy and run with it!
